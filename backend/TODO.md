# MongoDB Atlas Connection Setup TODO

- [x] Verify that the .env file contains the correct MongoDB Atlas connection string under the key `db_url`
- [x] Ensure the connection string includes your username, password, cluster URL, and database name
- [x] Run the backend server using `npm run dev` to test the connection
- [x] Check console logs for "Connected to database" message to confirm successful connection
- [x] Test API endpoints to verify database connectivity (e.g., make a GET request to http://localhost:5000/)
- [x] Create super admin user for login
